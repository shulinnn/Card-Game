### Goal of the game
The goal is to destroy enemy team  by using your predefined deck of cards u have chosen at the start of the game.

### Decks
For now planned decks are as stated below.

* Fire Deck
* Water Deck
* Ice Deck
* Void Deck
* Rock/Ground Deck

Each deck will contain about 20-30 unique cards within 3 basic types.
* Spells
* Enchantments
* Summons

##### Spells
Are spell cards which main goal is to deal damage and can be targeted on all 3 targets ( ground,minion and summoner)

##### Enchantment
Are basically Minion Enchantment cards as they're only target can be Minion whether hes ally or enemy.

##### Summon
Just a minion summon card.

##### You're Summoner

You as a Summoner will start with 100 health and 0 mana with 2 mana regen each second
You will be able to use Draw points to draw a card from your deck. You will first get 6 draw points at start of the round to be able to fill your hand with Cards , then u will receive 1 draw point after each 30 seconds of the round.
